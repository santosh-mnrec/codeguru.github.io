In this article, I will show you how to use boolean operators to perform really useful low level bit hacks.
Most people are used to just using AND and OR operators on integers, but this article goes into much more detail, explaining good – and fast – ways to manipulate integers at a bit level.

```
&   -  bitwise and
|   -  bitwise or
^   -  bitwise xor
~   -  bitwise not
<< -  bitwise shift left
>>  -  bitwise shift right
```
## How to check number is divisible by 2 using `bit`
Naive appraoach for checking number is to take the modulo of number by two,and if remainer is zero number is even otherwise it is odd. 
To check number is divisible by 2 used the following bit trick.

```csharp
void Main()
{
	int number=5;
	if((number&1)==0){
		Console.WriteLine("Number is even");
	}else{
		Console.WriteLine("Number is odd");
	}
}
```
## Divide by 2
By using bit wise operator you can multiply by 2
