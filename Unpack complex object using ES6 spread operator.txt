In this post, I will show you how to unpack a complex javascript object using the ES6 spread operator
Let's suppose you have the following javascript object

``` javascript
const person = {
  firstName: "santosh",
  lastName: "singh",
  address: {
    phone: {
      mobile: "99991235",
      countryCode: "60"
    },
    email: "santosh.singh@example.com"
  }
}
```
and you want to get `mobile` and `countryCode` from the object.

``` javascript
const {
    phone: {
      mobile,
      countryCode
    }
  
} = person;
console.log(mobile,countryCode); // 99991235,60
```

### How to rename the property while unpacking the object

Let's suppose you want to rename the property `mobile` as `mobileNumber` while using spread operator you can add a new property name using `:` as below

``` javascript
const {
    phone: {
      mobile:mobileNumber,
      countryCode
    }
  
} = person;
```
if you try to print `mobile` property javascript will throw an error that `mobile` is not defined because we renamed it to `mobileNumber`
