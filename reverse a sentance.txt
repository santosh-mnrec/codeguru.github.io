This post is a simple, fun example. In this post, I will show you a neat trick about LINQ.  You have to reverse a given sentence using LINQ. For example
Input
```
I love LINQ
```
Output
```
LINQ love I
```
There are several ways to solve this problem using LINQ. But we are going to use LINQ `Aggregate` operator which I have already discussed in my [post](https://www.codeguru.co.in/2020/05/how-to-convert-array-of-string-to-array.html)

```csharp
var sentence="I Love LINQ"
var result=sentence.Aggregate((a,b)=>b +" "+ a);
```
