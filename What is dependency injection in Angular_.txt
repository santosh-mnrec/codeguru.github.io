### What is dependency injection in Angular?

  

Angular is a standard web framework for developing SPA(Single Page Application) and Native application using javascript and HTML.

Dependency Injection is one of the core building blocks of Angular framework for developing `loosely coupled` application.

  
  

Dependency Injection is `design pattern` for developing `loosely coupled` application.

Dependices injection is a technique whereby one object supplies the dependency of another object.

  

There are several types of injection technique in software programming.

  

- Constructor Injection

- Property Injection

- Method Injection

  

In Angular, we used `Constructor Injection` technique for injecting the dependent object in the service/component.

  

``` javascript
import { Component, ElementRef, OnInit, NgZone, EventEmitter } from '@angular/core';


@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  template: `
<h1>Hello World</h1>
 
 `,
  styles: []
})
export class AppComponent {

   constructor(private service: SomeService) {

  }
  
  }
  
  

```
