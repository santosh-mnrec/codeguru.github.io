TL;DR 
Angular is a very popular web framework of developing SPA (Single Page Application) and Native Application using modern technology like typescript and rxjs.
Angular supports two types of compilation.

- AOT (Ahead of time Compilation) - In Browser
-  JIT (Just in time Compilation) - During Build

## What is JIT and AOT and their differences

The main differences between **JIT and AOT in Angular** are: Just-in-Time (**JIT**), compiles your app in the browser at runtime. Ahead-of-Time (**AOT**), compiles your app at build time on the server. **JIT** compilation is the default when you run the ng build (build only), or ng serve (build and serve locally)


## Advantage of AOT compilation
+ Faster rendering
+ Fewer network request
+ Smaller bundle size
+ Detects template error(s) at build time

## How to compile the angular app using `AOT.`
if you want to build your app using AOT compilation. Run the following command at the terminal

``` sh
	ng build --prod --aot=true
```
## Advantages of JIT Compilation
Below are some benefits of JIT compilation
+ No build required after changing the code
+  Good for local development because it's only built the change file.
