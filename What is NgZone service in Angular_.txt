## What is NgZone service in Angular?
  

+  `Zone.js` is one of the Angular dependencies which provides a mechanism, called zones, for encapsulating and intercepting asynchronous activities in the browser (e.g. `setTimeout`, `setInterval`, `promises`).

+ These zones are _execution contexts_ that allow Angular to track the start and completion of asynchronous activities and perform tasks as required (e.g. change detection). Zone.js provides a global zone that can be forked and extended to further encapsulate/isolate asynchronous behaviour, which Angular does so in its `NgZone` service, by creating a fork and extending it with its own behaviours.
