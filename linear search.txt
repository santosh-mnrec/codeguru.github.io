In this data structure series, I am going to discuss `Linear search`. In computer science, linear search or sequential search is an algorithm for finding elements in the list.
It sequentially loop the element until the element is found or the whole list is exhausted.
 
 ``` typescript
 function linearSearch(arr:number[],key:number){
 for(let i=0;i<arr.length;i++){
	 if(arr[i]===key){
		 return `item found at ${i}`;
		 else{
		 return `number not in the list`;
		 }
		 }
```

### Time and Space Complexity of Linear Search

- Worst complexity: O(n)
- Average complexity: O(n)
- Space complexity: O(1)
- Worst-case space complexity: O(1) iterative
