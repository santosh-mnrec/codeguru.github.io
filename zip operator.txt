As per the MSDN 'Linq` is
>Language-Integrated Query (LINQ) is the name for a set of technologies based on the integration of query capabilities directly into the C# language.

LINQ provides a lot of operator out of the box. There is one operator `Zip`, which is lesser-known. In this article, I will show how and where to use the LINQ `Zip` operator
`Zip` operator is used when you want to iterates multiple collections at the same time.
Let's consider the following example.
```csharp
var firstNames = new string[] { "John", "Bill", "Tim", "Santosh" };
var lastNames = new String[] { "Doe", "Gates", "Sanders", "Singh" };
```
We have two collections of string,first list have the firstName of the person and second list have lastName of the person.
Now you want to create a collection which has the full name like `John Doe`,`Bill Gates` etc.
In this scenario, we can use the `zip` operator.

```csharp
var fullName=firstNames.Zip(lastNames,(f,l)=> f +" "+l);
```
