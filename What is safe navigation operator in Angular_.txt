## What is safe navigation operator in Angular?

The **Safe Navigation Operator** is also known as the "**Elvis Operator**". This **operator** is very useful to protect against null and undefined values in property paths .
Let's suppose you have following component and you want to display email in the UI
``` javascript
import { Component } from  "@angular/core";
 @Component({
selector: "my-app",
templateUrl: "./app.component.html",
styleUrls: ["./app.component.css"]
})
export  class AppComponent {
user = null;
}
```

### Whiout Safe navigation operator
``` html
<h1>{{user.email}}</h1>
```
If you run the application you will see the following error in `console`
``` javascript
ERROR

Error: Cannot read property 'email'  of  null
```
### With safe navigation operator
``` html

<h1>{{user?.email}}</h1>
```
If you run the application will not see any error
